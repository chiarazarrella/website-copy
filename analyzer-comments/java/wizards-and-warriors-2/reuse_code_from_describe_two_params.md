# Reuse code from Describe two params

The `describe(Character, Destination)` method should reuse the logic implemented in `describe(Character, Destination, TravelMethod)` or in the individual methods `describe(Character)`, `describe(Destination)`, `describe(TravelMethod)`. 
Reusing existing methods can help make code easier to maintain.
